## **1. Purpose**

This policy establishes the rules governing access to systems, data, and resources within the Kingdom (the Organisation), ensuring that personal data is protected in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly Articles 5(1)(f), 24, 25, and 32.

This policy applies to:

- All Employees (Residents of the Realm)

---
## **3. Principles**

Access shall follow these principles:
### **🗝 Least Privilege**

No Resident shall hold more keys than necessary to perform their role.

Access rights are assigned according to role (Court Function), not personal preference.
### **🪞 Need-to-Know**

Personal data may only be accessed where required for legitimate business purposes.

When a Resident leaves the Realm, their keys shall be returned without delay.

## **4. Access Granting**

- Access must be formally requested and approved by the relevant Team Lead or Function Owner.
- Access rights shall be documented.
- Privileged access requires enhanced approval and justification.
- No self-issued keys are permitted.

---
## **5. Authentication Controls**

- Unique user accounts are mandatory.
- Strong authentication measures must be implemented.
- Multi-factor authentication shall be used where appropriate.
- Shared accounts are prohibited unless technically unavoidable and formally documented.

Masks may be worn at the tea party, but not in the system.

## **6. Access Review**

- Access rights shall be reviewed periodically.
- Privileged accounts shall be reviewed more frequently.

The Queen may inspect the keys at any time.

---
## **7. Termination & Role Changes**

- Access shall be removed or modified immediately upon termination or role change.
- Departed Residents shall not retain access to systems or personal data.

## **8. Technical and Organisational Measures**

The Organisation shall implement:

- Role-based access control (RBAC) 
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Logging and monitoring

- Incident response procedures
- 
These measures support GDPR Article 32 (Security of Processing).

---
## **9. Violations**

Unauthorized access, misuse of keys, or circumvention of controls may result in disciplinary action.

Even in Wonderland, rules apply.

---
## **10. Responsibility**

The Royal Workshop (IT & Security Function) is responsible for implementing and maintaining technical controls.

All Residents are responsible for safeguarding their credentials.
