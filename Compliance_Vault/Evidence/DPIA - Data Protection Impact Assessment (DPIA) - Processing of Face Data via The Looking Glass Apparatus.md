## **1. Overview of Processing**

**Project Name:** Through the Looking Glass – Inter-Realm Transition System
**Controller**: The Royal Workshop of Wonderland

The Looking Glass is a reflective portal enabling voluntary traversal between the Primary Realm and the Mirrored Realm.

When a user approaches the Looking Glass:

- A real-time reflection is rendered.
- The system models spatial inversion (left-right reversal).
- Upon voluntary physical interaction, the user may transition into the Mirrored Realm.
- Identity continuity is preserved across realms.

The processing includes:
- Real-time rendering of visual likeness 
- Spatial orientation modelling
- Transitional state synchronisation
- Identity continuity verification during crossing

No aesthetic modification or enhancement occurs.

No identification against external databases occurs.

No persistent biometric templates are created.

## **2. Nature of the Data**

  ### **Categories of Personal Data**

- Visual likeness (live reflection)
- Spatial positioning data
- Movement vectors during transition
- Identity continuity markers (temporary)
### **Special Category Consideration**

Facial data may qualify as biometric data under Article 4(14) GDPR where processed for unique identification.

The Looking Glass does **not** use facial data for identification or authentication.

Biometric templates are not stored, retained, or repurposed.

---
## **3. Purpose of Processing**

- Facilitation of voluntary inter-realm traversal
- Rendering of real-time reflective imagery
- Preservation of identity continuity across mirrored environments
- Maintenance of spatial coherence during transition
  
No automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects takes place.

The Mirrored Realm operates under its own logical inversion, but no profiling or behavioural scoring is conducted by the Controller.

---
## **4. Lawful Basis**

- Article 6(1)(b) – Performance of a contract (provision of portal service)
- Article 6(1)(a) – Consent (voluntary initiation of crossing)

If biometric qualification were determined:

- Article 9(2)(a) – Explicit consent

---
## **5. Assessment of Necessity and Proportionality**

The processing is strictly necessary to:

- Render reflection
- Enable crossing
- Preserve identity continuity

Data minimisation measures:

- No storage of reflection beyond real-time rendering
- No persistent biometric template
- No background monitoring
- No involuntary capture

Storage limitation:

- Transitional state data is deleted immediately upon successful crossing.
- Reflections are ephemeral.

---
## **6. Risk Assessment**

### **Identified Risks**

1. Unauthorized access to transitional state data
2. Cross-realm identity confusion
3. Inversion errors resulting in identity misalignment
4. Potential international transfer if mirror infrastructure is hosted beyond Wonderland
### **Inherent Risk Level (Pre-Mitigation):**

High (due to facial and transitional data processing)

---
## **7. Mitigation Measures**

  ### **Technical Measures**

- Encryption in transit (TLS equivalent)
- Ephemeral processing architecture
- No persistent biometric storage
- Segregated mirror-core environment
- Integrity validation during crossing
- Audit logging of portal activations
### **Organisational Measures**

- Golden Key Access Control Policy
- Role-based access to mirror infrastructure
- Processor agreements for any external hosting
- Incident response procedures
- Regular security testing of portal integrity
### **Safeguards Against Function Creep**

- No use for identification
- No behavioural profiling
- No tracking within Mirrored Realm
- No data sharing with Queen of Hearts Enforcement Unit without lawful basis
### **Risk Level (Post-Mitigation):**

Medium to Low

Residual risk remains inherent to reality-transition mechanics.

---
## **8. International Transfers**

If mirror infrastructure is hosted in Tulgey Wood (United States) or other non-Wonderland territories:

Safeguards include:

- Standard Contractual Clauses
- Transfer Impact Assessment
- Encryption at rest and in transit

---
## **9. Data Subject Rights**

Residents retain full rights under GDPR:

- Right of access
- Right to erasure
- Right to restriction
- Right to object
- Right to data portability
  
Erasure requests will not affect memories formed in the Mirrored Realm.

---
## **10. Consultation**

The Royal Workshop consulted:

- The Queen’s Court (Legal & Compliance)
- The Jabberwock Security Guild
- The Red Thread Risk Committee

Supervisory authority consultation was not required following mitigation.

---
## **11. Residual Risk Evaluation**

After safeguards:

- Risk of identification misuse: Low
- Risk of persistent biometric storage: None
- Risk of cross-realm misalignment: Medium (inherent)
- Risk of data breach: Low to Medium

Overall residual risk is deemed acceptable.
