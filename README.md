An experimental Obsidian vault for managing GDPR compliance using structured Markdown. Designed to work in Restricted mode with core plugins only.

It follows a bottom-up approach to governance documentation, modelling key elements such as RoPA, DPIAs, LIAs, DSR tracking, processors, and policies.

This repository is not legal advice and is not a production-ready compliance framework. It is a proof of concept demonstrating how Obsidian can be used to structure and manage GDPR documentation.

Take what works for you and adapt it to your own needs.
